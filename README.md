- This command reads all .yaml files in the deployment directory and applies them to your Kubernetes cluster, setting up your applicationâ€™s environment and securing it with necessary secrets.

kubectl apply -f deployment/

- This helps you confirm that your application instances are running as expected.

kubectl get deployments (or all)

- This step confirms that your application is up and reachable from outside the Kubernetes cluster.

kubectl get service your_service_name

- This command instructs Kubernetes to delete all resources described in the .yaml files within the deployment directory, effectively removing your application and its related configurations from the cluster.

- To ensure that all components of your application have been fully removed, you can check the current deployments:

kubectl get deployments
